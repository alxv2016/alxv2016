# Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm [**Alex**](https://demo.alxv.dev), a design/front-end developer from Toronto, Canada.

I specialize in **UI/UX, responsive web design, and frontend development**, with a knack for bridging the gap between developers and designers. My focus is on creating user-centric and accessible products through effective communication and collaboration.

>A development hand-off implies that design work is complete, I like to call it a **handshake** that denotes ongoing collaboration between design and development. It's not just about passing the baton; it's about maintaining a continuous dialogue for a seamless integration of design and development efforts.

Outside of work I'm interested in designing and 3D printing products and art toys. Drop me a follow [**@alxvcreates**](https://www.tiktok.com/@alxvcreates) if you're into 3D printing.
